Welcome to **Gaussian Viewer**, a Visual Studio Code extension that brings the power of the web-based **[SuperSplat](https://playcanvas.com/supersplat/editor)** editor directly into your development environment.

Our goal was to create a seamless bridge between your local workspace and SuperSplat's exceptional 3D Gaussian Splat editing capabilities.  
This extension allows you to view and interact with `.ply`, `.splat`, or `.gsplat` files without ever leaving VS Code.

## üåü Core Features

- **Direct SuperSplat Integration**: Harness the full viewing power of the SuperSplat editor inside a VS Code webview.
